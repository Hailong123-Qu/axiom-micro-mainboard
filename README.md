# AXIOM micro
A cheap open source camera.

While deveolping code for the AXIOM Beta, I wanted to have a working development
platform, without spending 3000â‚¬. This lead to the creation of the AXIOM Micro, wich
uses a FPGA SoC of the same family (Xilinx Zynq) but is imlemented using much lower
cost components. This leads to a highly reduced overall image quality, which is quite
bad for cinematography but not that important for Playing around and prototyping new ideas.

To reduce work,
